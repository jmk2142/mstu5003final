<h2>So how do you involve consumers practically?
</h2>

This planning matrix allows nonprofits to consider some of the key practical issues related to making participation a meaningful experience for consumers.
The matrix simply asks:
¥	What do you want to involve consumers in? A consultation, event, planning group, peer research, staff training? Something very generally of interest to a broad range of people or something very specific to a particular service?

¥	Why do you want to involve consumers? You want to tell people something; you want to know what they think about something? You want them to help you plan a piece of work? You have to!

¥	Who do you want to involve? Current or former of a service; specific groups, such as children, women, people with a dual diagnosis; or people with a geographical connection?

¥	When do you want to do it? What are your timescales? Do you need to start or finish this work by a certain date? Remember to allow time to plan and for feedback, and identify a next step.

¥	Where do you want to do it? Think of locations – virtual and physical - and accessible venues.

¥	How are you going to do it? How are you going to get answers for the questions above? How are you going to plan for the work? How are you going to recruit consumers? Have you thought about what consumers might get out of the work? Do you have a budget? Who is going to do the work? Do you have enough expertise in your work place? Do you need other expertise, knowledge or skills? How are you going to advertise the work to consumers? What method(s) of involvement are you going to use? How are you going to write up the piece of work? Who needs to see the outcomes? How are you going to feed back to consumers? Who is going to take forward the outcomes?
